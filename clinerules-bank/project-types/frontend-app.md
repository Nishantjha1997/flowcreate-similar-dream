# Frontend Application Guidelines

## Project Setup
- The project uses Vite for faster development and building
- TypeScript is configured for type safety
- ESLint is set up for code quality
- Prettier for code formatting

## Code Organization
- Organize code by feature or domain
- Keep related files close to each other
- Use clear, descriptive naming
- Follow established project structure

## UI/UX Standards
- Consistent design language across components
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Accessible to keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Support for light and dark themes

## Performance Optimization
- Minimize bundle size
- Lazy load components and routes
- Optimize image loading and rendering
- Monitor and address performance bottlenecks

## Testing
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for user flows
- Use testing-library/react for component testing

## Deployment
- Production builds are minified and optimized
- Assets are properly hashed for cache busting
- Environment variables are handled securely
- Hosting can be done via Netlify or custom domain

## Documentation
- Code should be self-documenting when possible
- Complex logic should have explanatory comments
- README should be kept up to date
- Include usage examples for reusable components
